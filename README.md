OG Extras
=========

Summary
-------

Extra functions, blocks, and views for Organic Groups 7.2. In particular, this module adds views and blocks needed by sites that are not using Panels, although it also may be useful to sites that do use Panels. This module is for Organic Groups 7.2. It will not work with Organic Groups 7.1.

This module was created because the default views and blocks that come with Organic Groups only work in Panels. It restores some of the functionality of the D6 version of Organic Groups.
